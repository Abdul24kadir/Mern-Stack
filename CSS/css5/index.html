    <h1>css position property</h1>
    <!-- 
    css position properties are:
    1.position = static (it is the default position for elements unless specified) 
    in this we could not able to apply top,left,right,bottom values
    
    to change the values and position of the element in the window we have some other position properties
    
    2.position = relative 
    - it is the position of the element with respective to the window .
    - it can be used to overlap elements 
    - its original gap space is still maintained
    - it can respond to values of top,left,right,bottom
    
    3.position = absolute
    - it is the position of the element with respective to the its nearest ancestor position
    - i cann be used to overlap elements
    - while overlapping the original gap space of the element is not maintained
    - it will respond to the values of top,left,right,bottom
    
    4.position = fixed 
    - it is ued to fix the element to window
    - even when you scroll the web page the element is still fixed to that position
